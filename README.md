# Persons Of Interest

Persons Of Interest(POI for short) is a python system that is built to help gather intelligence on suspicious individuals by means of profile building.

# Versions

There are Two versions of this system! There is a Local version and a remote version.
1.the remote version is for those who have top secret intel or highly sensitive targets that they are building intelligence on(the ideal usage) and cannot risk that data getting out.
2. the local version is for you to test out the system and test your version(if you edit the source code for your needs). That is the main purpose for the Local version , but the system would work perfectly fine locally for permanent usage! The only downside of using this system locally would be the un-necessary usage of MongoDb on your local machine , but if you don't care about hosting the mongo service to modify your data then this is perfect for you!!

# User experience
 
Persons Of Interest has a GUI version(Graphical User Interface) and A command line operated version for those of you who like quick operations. The command line version offers GUI data visualization (since viewing data on the command line isn't too idea).
