# Persons Of Interest

Persons Of Interest(P.O.I for short) is a Multi-platform system that is built to help gather intelligence on suspicious individuals by means of profile building.

# Versions

There are Two versions of this system! There is a Local version and a remote version(desktop).
1.the remote version is for those who have top secret intel or highly sensitive targets that they are building intelligence on(the ideal usage) and cannot risk that data getting out.
2. the local version is for you to test out the system and test your version(if you edit the source code for your needs). That is the main purpose for the Local version , but the system would work perfectly fine locally for permanent usage! The only downside of using this system locally would be the un-necessary usage of MongoDb on your local machine , but if you don't care about hosting the mongo service to modify your data then this is perfect for you!!

# This Version(Remote Desktop):

The client is created using Qt(C++) and sockets(winsock) while the server is created entirely in python!
This application is intended to be hosted remotely(after implementing SSL) for a secure remote system.
This version can be used for testing , but the local version is better equipt with tools for that specific purpose!
Feel free to make pull requests to improve the system as this is a work in progress.
